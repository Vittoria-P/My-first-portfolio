# My-first-portfolio

## The project

### Why ?

> Why the first ?
> The digital world is evolving very fast and I want to be able to make it evolve too.
> Its purpose is to have a specific place to show my work and to make the link between social networks and future projects.
> I still have a lot of work to do to make it look magical but it is functional, that's the most important!
> I have a lot of ideas and a lot of things to learn for that.

### What tech?

> Organisation : Notion
> Design : Canva & Figma
> Code : Html & Css : just the basics but efficient !
> It’s possible that they evolve… No it's for sure !

### Deployment

> Link to the deployment [My portfolio](https://vittoria-p.github.io/My-first-portfolio/)

> If you want to give me feedback, make a pull request or send me a mail <vittoriapellizzari.pro@gmail.com>

## Version 1.0

### The first upload

> The project was waiting for a quiet moment and one weekend, on a whim, I gathered my ideas on Notion, made the first visuals on Canva and the final version on Figma.
> And in less than 24 hours it was pushed

### The fix

> There were some details that I didn't really think about at the time. So, a week later, I went back to it and made some changes.
> The readme was too incomplete and unorganized
