# My-first-portfolio

### What tech?
Only Html and Css : just the basics but efficient !

### Why ?
I make this portfolio for challenge myself and also to get a first real look at my work.
I did this first draft in 24h but not only the code...
I put my different ideas on notion, made the first visuals on Canva and the more defined version on Figma.

I still have a lot of work to do to make it look magical but it is functional, that's the most important! I have a lot of ideas and a lot of things to learn for that. 

Its purpose is to have a specific place to show my work and to make the link between social networks and future projects.

## See you soon for new uploads !
